# 100daysofML
100 Days of Machine Learning Coding as proposed by Siraj Raval  
I will keep adding the codes and datasets as I go.  
Day 1: Starting [Bloomberg ML Lectures](https://bloomberg.github.io/foml/#lectures)  
Lecture 1- BLACK BOX MACHINE LEARNING - Introducing the standard ML problem types (classification and regression) and discuss prediction functions, feature extraction, learning algorithms, performance evaluation, cross-validation, sample bias, nonstationarity, overfitting, and hyperparameter tuning.  

Day 2:
Started Kaggle competition- https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
Covered EDA and Preprocessing part of the project. 

Day 3:

Building Xgboost and other ensemble models to evaluate the performance and choose the best scored model.
Hyperparameter tuning [Telco Churn xgboost](https://github.com/aman-sharma-nine/100daysofML/blob/master/xgboost_model.ipynb)

Day 4:
Read Chapter 2: Statistical Learning of ISLR 

Day 5:
Chapter 8: Tree-Based Methods
