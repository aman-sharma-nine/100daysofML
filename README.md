# 100daysofML
100 Days of Machine Learning Coding as proposed by Siraj Raval  
I will keep adding the codes and datasets as I go.  
Day 1:   
Starting [Bloomberg ML Lectures](https://bloomberg.github.io/foml/#lectures)  
Lecture 1- BLACK BOX MACHINE LEARNING - Introducing the standard ML problem types (classification and regression) and discuss prediction functions, feature extraction, learning algorithms, performance evaluation, cross-validation, sample bias, nonstationarity, overfitting, and hyperparameter tuning.  

This repo shows a basic model of telco churn problem
